# What is R?

## R

-   An open source language developed for statistical computing by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman
-   Developed at Bell labs in 1976 to make interactive data analysis easier
-   The ﬁrst oﬃcial version was released in 2000

## Why use R for data analysis?

- R is and will always be free
- Can easily implement any statistical analysis
- Code serves as a record which enables reproducibility
with minimal effort
- As of August 2024, there were over 21,000 open source packages to extend its
functionality
  - Highly customizable graphics ([ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/))
  - Analysis reports ([knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html))
  - RNA-seq analysis ([DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html))



# RStudio

## RStudio
-   RStudio is an integrated development
environment (IDE)  
-   An app that makes R code easier to write by providing a feature rich graphical user interface (GUI)

## Layout

## File types

-   **Rscript** files that end in `.R`
    -   The most basic, a file that contains only R code
-   **RMarkdown** files that end in `.Rmd`
-   Let's create a blank Rscript to see how they work, open RStudio and click:  
    -   File -\> New File -\> R Script

## R Markdown

-   A file format combining `R` code with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for text formatting.
-   Designed for creating reproducible research reports in various formats (HTML, PDF, Word).
-   Let's create an `Rmd` file in `RStudio` to explore the basics of how they work:
-   File -\> New File -\> R Markdown


## R Markdown Advanced Usage

-   **Presentations:** Creating slides (like these) with [revealjs](https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs).
-   **Publications:** Authoring online books that combine narrative, code, and output with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).
-   **Interactive Documents:** Developing interactive tutorials or dashboards with [learnR](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) and other embedded applications.

# Variables

## Variable definition
-    Variables store information that is referenced and manipulated
in a computer program
-    There are 3 ways to define variables in R, but one is preferred:
```{r}
x <- 1  # Preferred way
x = 1
1 -> x
print(x)
```

## Example
-   Run the following in the R console:

```{r}
x <- 1  
y <- 4
z <- y
x + y + z
```

# Error and Warning Messages

## Errors
-   **Errors**: Stop the execution of your code and must be fixed for the code to run successfully

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
y <- 10
z <- x + a
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
message("Error: object 'a' not found")
```


## Common Errors

- **Syntax Error:** Invalid R code syntax (e.g. misplaced parentheses)
```{r,echo=FALSE}
message('Error: unexpected ")"')
```

- **Object not found:** This variable is not defined (e.g. misspelled variables)

```{r,echo=FALSE}
message('Error: object "a" not found')
```


See this [article](https://statsandr.com/blog/top-10-errors-in-r/) for more common errors and how to fix them.

## Warnings
-   Do not stop the execution but indicate potential issues that you should be aware of and might need to address

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
b <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
result <- a + b
```


## Variable Naming

-   Variables names must start with a letter and can contain
underscores and periods
-   It is best practice to use descriptive variable names and stick
to one style of names

```{r}
# Snake case
dog_breeds <- c("Labrador Retriever", "Akita", "Bulldog")

# Period separated
dog.breeds <- c("Labrador Retriever", "Akita", "Bulldog")

# Camel case
DogBreeds <- c("Labrador Retriever", "Akita", "Bulldog")
```

## Poll 2

**Which variable name is not valid in R?**

1.    cat_dog
2.    CatDOG
3.    cat.dog
4.    catD*g


## Excercise 1
-   Open Rscript file part_1.R in Rstudio

# Data Types and Structures

## Data Types
- Integer
    - Whole numbers (denoted with L ex. 1L,2L)
- Numeric
    - Decimal numbers
- Logical
    - Boolean (TRUE, FALSE)
- Character
    - Letters and strings of letters
    - "A", "Labrador Retriever"

## Missing Values
-   R has a special data type - NA which represents missing data
-   NAs can take the place of any type but by default are logical
```{r}
NA + 1
```


## Poll 3

**Which of these is not the correct data type for the value?**

1.  "1.5" - Numeric
2.  "A" - Character
3.  1L - Integer
4.  TRUE - Boolean/Logical



## Data Structures
- Vectors
    - Atomic vectors - one dimensional lists that store values of
    the **same type**
    - Lists - can be multidimensional and contain **different types/structures** (ex. nested lists)
- Factors
    - Ordered list with assigned levels
- Matrix
    - Columns and rows of the **same type**
- Data frames
    - Columns and rows of **mixed types**

## Exercise 2: Data Types and Structures
-   Reopen Rscript file part_1.R in Rstudio


# 10 min break

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}

countdown::countdown(minutes = 10,
                     seconds = 0,
                     color_border = "black",
                     color_running_background = "#47d193",
                     color_finished_background = "#a3184e",
                     padding = "50px",
                     margin = "5%",
                     font_size = "5em",
       style = "position: relative; width: min-content;")
```

</center>

# Math and Logic Operations

## Math & Logic

- Built in functions to get common mathematical summaries of data (eg. mean( ), median( ), mode( ) )
- Relational comparison operators to compare values

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x == y  # Equal to
x != y  # Not equal to
x <  y  # Less than
x > y   # Greater than
x <= y  # Less than or equal to
x >= y  # Greater than or equal to

x %in% y # Is x in this vector y?
```




## Logical Operators
  - Logical operators can compare TRUE or FALSE values
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE

!x     # Not x
x | y  # x or y
x & y  # x and y
```

## Poll 4

**What is the output of the following code?**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
2 + 2 == 4 & 8 + 10 < 20
```

1.  TRUE
2.  FALSE
3.  NA

## Poll 5

**What is the output of the following code?**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE

y | (y | x)
```

1.  TRUE
2.  FALSE
3.  NA

## Conditional execution

-   Relational and logical operations allow for conditional
execution of code

```{r}
dog_breeds <- c("Labrador Retriever", "Akita", "Bulldog")

if ("Akita" %in% dog_breeds) {
  
  print("dog_breeds already contains Akita")
  
} else {
  
  dog_breeds <- c("Akita", dog_breeds)
  
}

```

# Functions

## Functions

-  A function is block of organized, reusable code that is used to
perform a single action
-  R has many built in functions, these are called **base R** functions
-  Not all arguments are required and some have default values

![Functions](assets/functions.png)

## Defining a function
-   To define a function we use the function keyword, the output is specified with the **return** function:
```{r}
add_dog <- function(dog_to_add, input_vector) {
  if (dog_to_add %in% input_vector) {
    
    print("Already contains this dog")
    
  } else {
    
    output <- c(dog_to_add, input_vector)
    return(output)
    
  }
}
```

## Example
```{r}
add_dog(dog_to_add = "Akita",
        input_vector = dog_breeds)
```

```{r}
add_dog(dog_to_add = "German Shepard",
        input_vector = dog_breeds)
```

## Poll 6

**What does this function do?**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mystery_function <- function(x) {
  if (x > 0) {
    return(x)
  } else {
    return(-x)
  }
}
```

1. Returns the absolute value of x
2. Returns x
3. Returns the square root of x
4. Returns -x



# Packages

## Packages
-    Packages are collections of functions that are specialized to a specific task (plotting, data manipulation etc.)

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # Makes all of the ggplot2 functions available
```


-    The tidyverse is a collection of commonly used data analysis
packages  
      -   Learning curve is less steep
      -   Lots of useful packages for cleaning and "wrangling" data into the correct format

## Why use Tidyverse Packages?

-   Much of the work in data analysis is getting data into the correct format to create outputs (plots and tables)
-   The tidyverse collection of packages simplifies this process
    -   Intuitive syntax
    -   Comprehensive (data manipulation, cleaning, modeling and graphics)
    -   Consistent data structure
    -   Strong community support
