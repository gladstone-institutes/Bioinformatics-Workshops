# The Unix Command-line


## What is Unix?

- A family of operating systems that date back to 1970s
- Designed to run on different types of computer hardware
- macOS and Linux are descendants of Unix
- Often used in industry and scientific research


## What is the Command-line?

- A text-based interface for interacting with the operating system
- Execute commands to perform various tasks like:
  - Navigating the file system
  - Editing files
- Command-line interfaces (CLIs) are how users interacted with computers before graphical interfaces like Windows

## Advantages of using CLIs

- Allows for automation and batch processing of data
- Provides more control and flexibility over data manipulation
- Interact with High-Performance Computing clusters (HPCs) like Wynton
- Speed


## The Terminal

- The software that provides access to the CLI
- Open your terminal

  - Mac: press Cmd + Space and type "terminal"
  - Linux: press Ctrl+Alt+T
  - Windows: open the Ubuntu app

## Download the workshop materials

- Copy and paste each of these into your terminal, press enter after each one:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

mkdir unix_workshop
```


```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

cd unix_workshop
```

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
curl -L -o unix_workshop.tar.gz 'https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tdzpoivf7mienlenunqhf/unix_workshop.tar.gz?rlkey=6bfxnqgc5n4lgc9mc80ld75z4&dl=0'
```


```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

tar -xzf unix_workshop.tar.gz
```


```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

cd unix_workshop
```




## The shell

- A shell is a specific type of CLI that provides access to the OS as a whole
- There are several different Unix shells
  - Bash : The most widely used and the default shell on most Linux systems
  - Zsh : an extended version of Bash and is now the default on newer versions of macOS

## The shell

- Check which shell you are using by typing:

```{bash}
#| echo: true

echo $0
```

- We will use bash since it is the most widely used shell
- If your shell is not set to bash, type `chsh -s /bin/bash` and press enter


## Commands

Shell commands are basic instructions used to perform specific tasks.

`command_name -[option(s)] [argument(s)]`


Example:
```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
ls -lah part_1
```

Here we are providing multiple options to the `ls` command and the directory **part_1** as an argument

- To cancel a command press CTRL+C

## man: pull up the manual page for a command

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
man echo
```


```{bash}
#| echo: false
man -P cat echo | col -b
```

## Manual pages

Use the arrow keys to navigate the manual and press `q` to close it

```{bash}
#| echo: false
man -P cat man | col -b
```

## echo: print a string or value of a variable

- **Variables** : a named container that holds a value or data
- **Strings** : sequence of characters
```{bash}
#| echo: true
message="Hello, World"
echo $message
```

Here, we assign the string "Hello, World!" to the variable `message` and use echo to print its value.

## history: list previously run commands
- You can also cycle through previously run commands using the up and down arrow keys
- By default bash stores the last 500 commands, zsh stores the last 1000

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
history
```

- Use the command `clear` to clear the output from the terminal


# Navigating the File System

## The File System

![](materials/UNIX_filesystem.png)


## Paths


- Root directory  `/`
- Current working directory `.`
- Directory above the current one `..`
- User home directory `~`
- Absolute: The path starting from root
  - `/data/file1.txt`
- Relative: Path from the current directory
  - `./file1.txt`

##
<center>What is the absolute path to **file2.txt**?</center>

![](materials/UNIX_filesystem.png)

##
<center>What is the realative path to **file1.txt** if the working directory is **/home/user** ?</center>
![](materials/UNIX_filesystem.png)

## pwd: print working directory

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
pwd
```

```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
echo "/Users/your_username/unix_workshop"
```

- The default working directory when you log in or open a terminal is your user home directory `~`


## ls: list contents of a directory {.small-bullets}


```{bash}
#| echo: true
ls .
```


- `-l ` show more information (file permissions and size)
- `-a ` show all (hidden files)
- `-h ` file sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K, 2G)


```{bash}
#| echo: true
ls -lah part_1
```




## cd: move to a directory

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
cd unix_workshop/part_1
ls -l
```

```{bash}
#| echo: false
cd part_1
ls -l
```

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
cd ..
ls -l
```

```{bash}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
ls -l
```




# Creating and Altering Files


## File Permissions

![](materials/File permissions.png)

- Permissions for a file or folder are represented by 10 characters
- Each group of 3 represents the permissions for different users:
  - Owner of the file/folder
  - Group the owns the file
  - Others - everyone else

## File Permissions

![](materials/File permissions.png)

- There are three types of permissions:
  - r - read/view the contents of a file/folder
  - w - write
  - x - execute the file or access a directory

## touch: create an empty file
```{bash}
#| echo: true
touch new_file.txt
```

- If the file exists, it will update the time stamp


## mkdir: make a directory
```{bash}
#| echo: true
mkdir new_directory
```

- `-p ` make parent directories if they don't exist

## mv: move a file or folder
```{bash}
#| echo: true
mv new_file.txt new_directory
```

- Also used to rename files/folders

```{bash}
#| echo: true
mv new_directory/new_file.txt new_directory/new_file1.txt
```

## cp: copy a file or folder
```{bash}
#| echo: true
cp new_directory/new_file1.txt new_directory/new_file2.txt
```
* `-r ` to copy a folder (recursive)



## rm: remove a file permanently

- This command should always be used with care since the files it is used on **cannot be recovered**

```{bash}
#| echo: true
rm new_directory/new_file2.txt
```

## du: check the size of a file or folder

```{bash}
#| echo: true
du -h */*
```
- h - Displays the output in human readable format

## Text editors

- Command-line text editors provide lots of key board shortcuts to navigate and alter files
- Some commonly used ones are:
  - Vim : Feature rich, steep learning curve
  - nano : Simple and user friendly

## nano {.big-picture}

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| output: false
nano new_directory/new_file1.txt
```
![](materials/nano.png)

## Shortcuts for nano {.less-small-bullets}


- Ctrl + X :&nbsp; Exit nano
- Ctrl + O :&nbsp; Save the file (write Out)
- Ctrl + W :&nbsp; Search for a string or regular expression
- Ctrl + K :&nbsp; Cut (remove) the current line or selection
- Ctrl + U :&nbsp; Uncut (paste) the most recently cut text
- Ctrl + A :&nbsp; Move the cursor to the start of the current line
- Ctrl + E :&nbsp; Move the cursor to the end of the current line
- Ctrl + G :&nbsp; Show the help menu

# Installing Software

## Package managers

- Used to install and manage software

- macOS
  - [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - not included with the OS and needs to be installed
- WSL/Linux
  - [apt-get](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) - included with Ubuntu

We will not install any software in this workshop but these are how you would
access additional software/commands.



# Downloading Files


## curl: download files from the internet

- We used curl at the begining download the materials
- curl supports multiple protocols but the most commonly used one is HTTPS

```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| output: false
curl -o part_2/homo_sapiens.refseq.tsv.gz https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_tsv/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.115.refseq.tsv.gz
```

- `-o` gives the output file name and location

## Other file transfer tools

- wget : like curl, supports fewer protocols and is not always installed
- scp (secure copy) : used to encrypt and transfer files using SSH protocol
  - Commonly used to transfer files on HPCs (Wynton)
Example:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| output: false
scp /path/to/local/file user@remote.host:/path/to/remote/directory
```

# Searching Files and Combining Commands

## grep: searching files with regular expressions

- Search the contents of the input file and returns the lines that have a match

- **Regular Expressions** : sequence of characters that forms a search pattern

```{bash}
#| echo: true
grep "7" part_1/list_numbers.tsv
```

## grep options

- -i : ignore case
- -v : invert match
- -r : recursively searches in all files and subdirectories of a directory
- -c : counts the number of matches found in each file

## Regular Expressions

- For a more extensive overview of regular expressions click [here](https://regexone.com/lesson/introduction_abcs)
- Some basic ones are:
  - " ^ "    Matches the beginning of a line
  - " . "  Matches any single character except newline
  - " $ "    Matches the end of a line


```{bash}
#| echo: true
grep "3$" part_1/list_numbers.tsv
```

## head/tail: view the first or last n lines of a file

```{bash}
#| echo: true
head -n 1 part_1/list_numbers.tsv
```

```{bash}
#| echo: true
tail -n 1 part_1/list_numbers.tsv
```

- The default n is 10
- Useful for getting a look at the format of a file

## cat: print the contents of a file

```{bash}
#| echo: true
cat part_1/list_numbers.tsv
```


## cut: get specific columns from a file

```{bash}
#| echo: true
cut -f 1-3,6 part_1/list_numbers.tsv
```

- -f : fields that should be returned
- -d : delimiter - character that the columns are separated by

By default `cut` expects columns to be separated by tab characters.


## Combining Commands

- Pipes "|" connect one command to another
- The output of the previous command is used as the input for the next one
- Chaining commands allows you to do complex operations on text streams

```{bash}
#| echo: true
grep "3$" part_1/list_numbers.tsv | cut -f 1-3
```

## Output to a file

- The output of any command can be written to a file with the " > " character

```{bash}
#| echo: true
grep "3$" part_1/list_numbers.tsv | cut -f 1-3 > part_1/subset_list_numbers.tsv
```



## tr: translate or substitute characters

```{bash}
#| echo: true
cat part_1/list_numbers.tsv | tr "\t" "," > part_1/list_numbers.csv
cat part_1/list_numbers.csv
```



## sort: sort values

```{bash}
#| echo: true
cat part_1/list_numbers.csv | cut -d "," -f 1 | sort -n
```

- -n : sort numerically (default is alphabetical)

```{bash}
#| echo: true
cat part_1/list_numbers.csv | cut -d "," -f 8 | sort -nu
```

- -u :  sort and remove duplicates


# End of Part 1
